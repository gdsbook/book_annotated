This book is best followed if you can reproduce the examples and tutorials provided with it. To do so, you will need to install in your machine a series of software packages. These are all open-source and available for free to download. Although there are several ways to approach this process, we first show the simplest way to install the whole software stack in either Windows, macOS or Linux, and then list the libraries that the previous process will install and that are necesary for an interactive read of the book.
