[![Build annotated book](https://github.com/gdsbook/book/actions/workflows/build_website.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/gdsbook/book/actions/workflows/build_website.yml)

## Book version

This repository is currently cloning version [`v0.5`](https://github.com/gdsbook/book/releases/tag/v0.5) of the [GDS Book](https://geographicdata.science/book).

## Book source

This repository does _not_ include new or different content than that in the official repository of the GDS Book:

> [https://github.com/gdsbook/book](https://github.com/gdsbook/book)

The only differences between both repositories are the highlights and (potential) annotations in this repository.
